      <p>Let me play BOTW so re4 placeholder<br>
         Right Click to go into gun mode (is that what it's called)? <br>
         Minus to open map <br>
         Plus to open options <br>
         Command (ctrl (I'm on mac)) to open inventory <br>
         While it is annoying, to go back through any menu, right click. You know what, fuck it. Right click it, put | and put `Alt` for menus. <br>
         I might change it, but z to skip cutscenes and command Ashley. I haven't made it to that part yet.<br>
         You don't have to use home for the game, but you have use tab or space.<br>
         Up, Down, Left, Right, a believe for menus.<br>
         We use q, if you want to use knife with it you can, but I use it to shake off zombies.<br>
         Cursor to aim.<br>
         WASD to move.<br>
         Middle Click to pull out knife and Left Click while holding it to stab.<br>
         Shift to run.<br>
         And that's it. All you have to do is play and eventually it'll be super easy for you. Have fun!!! </p>
