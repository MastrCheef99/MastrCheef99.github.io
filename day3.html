      <h2>Quick update to my blog</h2>
      <p>So I'm gonna shift to more full posts rather than a rant/public diary but I'll keep making these dated posts for anything not big enough for a full post or just updates<br></p>
      <h2>Picofly Modchip</h2>
      <p>My friend C who I'm hacking with and I are going to build the nintendo switch picofly modchip in like 2 weeks. I'll document the process then. People say the materials are<br>
      "under 10 dollars" or "3 dollars" but currently the boards are like 4.60 something + 1.48 for shipping for that + 2.28 for 3 resistors + I got the wires for free. It's like 7 dollars<br>
      for me but the normal person will buy the boards for 10 dollars at waveshare to it's a bit misleading. It's way less than HWflys. I'm considering selling them for my overhead + 1 dollar<br></p>
      <h2>Dicking around with recovery mode</h2>
      <p>So at my school, we have a robotics class. In my robotics class, we have actual desktop computers instead of shitty chromebooks. One of them is in recovery mode. Sam and I are just<br>
      dicking around in it any he's going to bring a usb drive with a file explorer, git, and whatever else tommorrow to make our lives easier. We did shit like using mkdir to hopefully send the<br>
      admins a message to fix there computers and rmdir to remove the french canadian language but for some reason, no changes save after rebooting the computer. We used dir to see what .exes we could run<br>
      and found some funny shit. One thing was about disk partitioning or creating a new drive or something. wpeinit.exe literally just opened up a transparent window for literally less than a second.<br>
      The last funny one was at the end, we ran some fucking exe that just straight blue screen. I burst out laughing for some reason. Hmm, maybe I will make a full post about this. Cya</p>
