      <h1>The Problem With Privacy Browsers</h1>
      <p>Today I heard about Mullvad Browser today, with it being like tor without the network, so I downloaded it. It's firefox based so I put all of add ons there. I did the cover your tracks test.
      <p>The tests were with Librewolf, Mullvad, Tor, Safari, and my Hardened Firefox on MacOS. We're looking at protecting you from fingerprinting.</p>
      <h2>Test</h2>
        <h3>Librewolf</h3>
          <p>Your browser has a nearly-unique fingerprint. 1 in 39303.83</p>
        <h3>Mullvad Browser</h3>
          <p>Your browser has a nearly-unique fingerprint. 1 in 47160.6.</p>
        <h3>Tor</h3>
          <p>Yes (obviously). 1 in 1161.69</p>
        <h3>Safari</h3>
          <p>Partial Protection. 1 in 10718.36</p>
        <h3>Firefox</h3>
          <p>Partial protection. 1 in 11211.57</p>
