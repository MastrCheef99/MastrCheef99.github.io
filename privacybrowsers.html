      <h1>The Problem With Privacy Browsers</h1>
      <p>Today I heard about Mullvad Browser today, with it being like tor without the network, so I downloaded it. It's firefox based so I put all of add ons there. I did the cover your tracks test.
      <p>The tests were with Librewolf, Mullvad, Tor, Safari, and my Hardened Firefox on MacOS. We're looking at protecting you from fingerprinting.</p>
      <h2>Test</h2>
        <h3>Librewolf</h3>
          <p>Your browser has a nearly-unique fingerprint. 1 in 39303.83</p>
        <h3>Mullvad Browser</h3>
          <p>Your browser has a nearly-unique fingerprint. 1 in 47160.6.</p>
        <h3>Tor</h3>
          <p>Yes (obviously). 1 in 1161.69</p>
        <h3>Safari</h3>
          <p>Partial Protection. 1 in 10718.36</p>
        <h3>Firefox</h3>
          <p>Partial protection. 1 in 11211.57</p>
      <h2>Let's spreadsheet it</h2>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Browser</th>
            <th>Ratio (Ascending and rounded)</th>
            <th>Bits of Info</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tor</td>
            <td>1 in 1162</td>
            <td>10.18</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Safari</td>
            <td>1 in 10718</td>
            <td>13.39</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Firefox</td>
            <td>1 in 11212</td>
            <td>13.46</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>LibreWolf         </td>
            <td>1 in 39304</td>
            <td>15.26</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mullvad</td>
            <td>1 in 47161</td>
            <td>15.53</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      <p>It's late, so I'll analyze this tommorow</p>
      <h2>It's tomorrow</h2>
      <p>I'm really glad that as a last second decision I added bits because it shows a pattern. There is a very strong positive correlation between bits of info and uniqueness.<br>
      To see how much bits affect uniqueness, I created this equation y=3.226^(x-5.5) (which is divided by 100) which has a margin of error of about 1 or 2 per most points. That means that for every bit, the amount of info
      multiplies by 32.26 every bit. There is not much more to be drawn besides that privacy focused browsers end up looking extremely unique and oddly giving away the most information.</p>
