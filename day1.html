      <p>Today I want to introduce the blog and talk a bit about my self. If I had a bio for that info stealing bird app, it would contain "programmer" or "developer.  
      That looks pretentious and good right? Hello there, I go by the handle of MastrCheef99 and I program for a game site, my blog, and a couple games.   </p>
      <h2>Part 1 - Game site</h2>
      <p>I work on the game site supreme games, which I will not post the link to. I don't have a title, but I think "lead designer" would fit me best. I don't do much programming,  
        and I only add retro games using a site called emulatorjs which gives you an easy way to add retro games. In the future, I may post an example. However, to the lead designer,  
        I came up with many ideas for the sites ui, such as a homepage that uses analytics, our color scheme, a more user friendly proxy and I am in the proccess of changing all of our icons  
        to be more consistent. Next section  </p>
      <h2> Part 2 - Blog </h2>
      <p> I just started this blog so I can talk about emulation, especially my settings and button mappings, and my developer competition. WARNING: THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY BLOG JUST EMULATION. I use an m1 mac so my options are limited,  
        though I plan to purchase a pc later this summer, probably in July. I emulate NES, SNES, and N64 begrudgingly through retroarch. I recently switched to open emu because, even if you change  
        the mapping on retroarch, IT DOESN'T FUCKING CHANGE. I noticed this during Super Mario World. I wanted to swap my Z and X key's functions but they wouldn't change. No N64 emulator actually  
        works on my mac besides through retroarch. I tried installing mupen 64 but it couldn't get graphics drivers or something so I have to use retroarch. I also use wii vc in dolphin  
        when I'm really fed up. Going down the generations, I believe the GB/GBC/GBA is next. For these, I use mGBA NOT under retroarch. I don't play gba games but I would like to play mother 3 soon.  
        Keeping on the handheld track, I use melon ds for ds games. I only have this for zelda as I originally wanted to play all the zelda game before TOTK but that never happened.  
        I obviously use dolphin, currently I'm playing RE4 and Jungle Beat, Wii version on both as it is easier to emulate. For Jungle Beat (I'll post the mappings later) I really tried to capture the hilarity of the original controls.  
        For ps1, I use Duckstation on its own. It's perfect for CTR, in which I'm addicted to time trials on crash cove, and MGS1, which I stream from time to time.  
        on the topic of Playstation, my computer can't get decent framerates on pcsx2 and my xbox controller doesn't work with rpcs3.  
        circling back to Nintendo Consoles I'd like to emulate, on my shitty 2020 macbook air, my CEMU immediately crashes whenever I try to play anything. Citra doesn't work on M1 and yuzu or ryujinx don't have mac.  
        I'm going on a long trip this summer so I won't be able to get a pc in time to play TOTK at better framerates and resolutions so I'll probably replay it when I get back.  
        On xbox emulation, I just use backwards compatibility with my series s and most xbox emulators don't work with mac. That's all on emulation so, next section. </p>
      <h2> Part 3 - Game making/competition </h2>
      <p> So I'll touch on the games I have made in the past. My friends and I made a text based survival game called survival island that was upgraded to buttons at the end. It was javascript alerts and then I don't know what. I'll upload an early version later.  
          We then made a top down survival game called Survival Island but Starve.io, at this link https://survival-island.samuelmerlin1.repl.co/. No I am not Sam. He is my friend who is the creator and main programmer of the two games.  
          Now I would like the talk about my competition. So I'm on my friend's youtube/tiktok discord server which I used to be a mod for but I had a falling out with that friend over his minecraft addiction.  
          Recently, I got invited to a game testing server by a mod on that server named captain pickletron. I had a 15 minute chat with him and all I got from him was that the game is in roblox about magic. He said it would push the limits of roblox.  
          He was extremely naiive of roblox and unity as he wanted to put the game on steam at some point. Other then that, he was being paranoid and not telling me anything because he thought someone would steal it. I called him out as a "paranoid piece of shit" my words exactly  
          He kicked me out so I proceeded to harrass him on the server and in DMs in my prodding I said I'd make a better game than him. In the next line I will describe my ideas.  
          The 3 games will be made in unity. The first ones will be part of my "there is no" or "there are no" series (don't strike me there is no game). The first game will be called There Are No Jumpscares. SPOILERS At the start of the game, a monster will slowly walk up to you and do a screamer.  
          The player should think "oh so the title is a lie." But it's not anymore. You will go through normal jumpscare situations, like you are walking down a hallway and the music stops. No jumpscare. A character peeks and then disappears. No jumpscare. Along those lines.  
          Game 2 would be There Is No Isekai. Same thing. You jump off of a building and get caught in a parachute. You fall into train tracks but just get back up. At the end, you get hit by a truck and just die. It'll be fun. I hope to gain experience by making these and then making game 3.  
          I don't know what I'll do for game 3. With my experience, I'd like to make a metroidvania but I might need to learn a bit different for 2d games. I don't have an idea but hollow knight is my favorite and most played game. I'll think of something. That's all for my main post today. <p>
