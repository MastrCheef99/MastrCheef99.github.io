        <h2>So I guess this makes me officially edgy now</h2>
        <p>Recently I decided I wanted to get into music reviewing. I like listening to music and
            especially because none of my friends or family seem to like my autism music, I'm stuck
            yapping into the void. Anyway Death Grips is kind of known as this sort of internet-core
            hip-hop band that is very inaccessible. The instrumentals consist of harsh sounds and the
            rapping is often just Mc Ride yelling. Basically, it sounds like absolute dogshit to most
            people. In the past I've leaned toward liking more experimental rappers like JPEGMAFIA,
            Danny Brown, and Billy Woods, but Death Grips has always just been there. I mean I tried
            listening to the Money Store before but besides<br></p>
            <h2>Get Got</h2>
            <p>nothing stuck. Get Got has like an
            actual beat, Mc Ride has an actual flow, and it's a pretty easy listen. Crazy sample, was
            cool finding out that the entire song is basically built on a 2 second sample from some random
            collection of songs found on subsaharan cellphones. We'll get to that further on a different
            track. Anyway one thing I like about this song is that it's just kinda fun to rap along to. Like
            the words in the chorus just roll right off the tongue and the flow is fun. Around 30 seconds in
            and repeating throughout the track is this really nice more chopped version of the sampled part.
            This is where I get into my area of least expertise: lyrics. I usually have trouble picking out
            lyrics from songs with completely normal vocals. I just can't interpret on the fly. At best, the
            words go in one ear and out the other. One reason this review will take so long to right is A) I
            have a lot to say and B) I have to go look up the lyrics for each song to really understand them.
            From my reading on the genius annotations, Get Got seems to be about a car chase with the cops that
            Ride is in. He recklessly drives and seems to run a red light or pass a cop car and get in a crash.
            The second verse seems to talk more about just rap or making music in general, with Ride sort of
            bragging about his skill. Verse three gets more cryptic. There are pieces about duality like
            fire and water and references to the practice of trepanning I can pick out which seems to be about
            setting your thoughts free but this verse is quite tough to interpret. Anyway, overall, this is a
            great start to the album and even though I don't think it does a great job of representing the sounds
            on the rest of the album, It sounds good and is probably the only reason I kept listening. And then
            you get dropped into the thick of it (ksi referenece?) with <br></p>
            <h2>The Fever (Aye Aye).</h2> 
            <p>
                This is a much more traditional Death Grips song. It has some distorted main instrumental loop
                that sounds like it's partway between a saw and a vacuum cleaner. This song almost sounds like
                a factory or something with the sort of monotonous (not a bad thing) sounding drums. Mc Ride
                really starts to yell on this track and the energy goes crazy. Then the hook comes along with
                this nice funky melody that I just love. It sounds amazing. And that last chorus where all but
                the drums and Ride cut out is cool too. Overall this is just an excelently arranged track and
                if you are the type of person who enjoys the sound of Death Grips, it's quite catchy. Also by
                now I've decided that I'm dogshit at writing about lyrics especially cryptic ones like Death
                Grips so I won't even bother. I didn't start listening to them for the lyrics anyway.

            <h2>Lost Boys</h2>
            <p>
                This song has the most robotic aesthetic production on the whole album. The immaculate
                intro where you can't really pick out what is going on and then the random noise coalesces
                into this amazing beat is heavenly. Then you get the text-to-speach sounding repetition
                of the word lost boy. This brings in even more of the robotic sounds. Ride has a quick verse
                and then the production sort of starts to break down. Half the the ticking sounds seem to
                drop off the face of the earth and overall this leads into a much more distorted sounding
                second verse. Ride has a longer verse now which sounds good. I don't really have much to say
                about the rapping on this song just the production. The third chorus of lost boys starts to
                distort the voice a bit more, though it comes back for the second half. I think the drumline
                loses another hit and this song seems to be going for the vibe of a rabbit hole. Ride's line
                "it's such a long way down" combined with the buildup of distortion contribute to this theme.
                Once again with my "overall", this track is a great addition to the album that I didn't
                really appreciate enough until writing this.

            <h2>Blackjack</h2>
            <p>
                It's hard for me to put into words what I like about this track. The beat is kind of nice and 
                bouncy sounding and there is no real melody. The melody comes from the layered effects on Ride's 
                voice. Then we get a beat switch like 40 seconds into the song with much "crunchier" sounding
                drums and a droning note that creates a melody while sliding up and down. This was the easiest
                song to pick out lyrics to from reading them, with Blackjack seemingly being a metaphor for 
                something. Once again, if you came for lyrical discussion you came to the wrong place. Overall,
                the simple beat sounds great with the support from Ride's vocals.

            <h2>Hustle Bones</h2>
            <p>
                Death Grips can really do a beat drop. This song starts with like a car or lawnmower sounding
                note that slides up until an extremely hard beat drop. I almost can't help but yell the
                succeeding lines "Give a fuck whatchya heard yeah, fuck whatchya heard." It just sounds good.
                Zach goes crazy on the drumline and Ride slows down the flow. Then the chorus comes in with
                this heavenly sounds that I can't decide if it is a synth preset or a chopped up sample of a
                girl singing. This repeats. I don't have much to say except this song goes hard. I come back to
                it pretty often if just for that beat drop. Ok it's 0:29 rn and I really want to write about
                I've Seen Footage because it's a banger but I'll do it tomorrow.
