        <h1>The Money Store Review</h1>
        <p style = "font-size: 7px;">By Mastrcheef99, Jan 10, 2025</p>
        <h2>So I guess this makes me officially edgy now</h2>
        <p>Recently I decided I wanted to get into music reviewing. I like listening to music and
            especially because none of my friends or family seem to like my autism music, I'm stuck
            yapping into the void. Anyway Death Grips is kind of known as this sort of internet-core
            hip-hop band that is very inaccessible. The instrumentals consist of harsh sounds and the
            rapping is often just Mc Ride yelling. Basically, it sounds like absolute dogshit to most
            people. In the past I've leaned toward liking more experimental rappers like JPEGMAFIA,
            Danny Brown, and Billy Woods, but Death Grips has always just been there. I mean I tried
            listening to the Money Store before but besides<br></p>
            <h2>Get Got</h2>
            <p>nothing stuck. Get Got has like an
            actual beat, Mc Ride has an actual flow, and it's a pretty easy listen. Crazy sample, was
            cool finding out that the entire song is basically built on a 2 second sample from some random
            collection of songs found on subsaharan cellphones. We'll get to that further on a different
            track. Anyway one thing I like about this song is that it's just kinda fun to rap along to. Like
            the words in the chorus just roll right off the tongue and the flow is fun. Around 30 seconds in
            and repeating throughout the track is this really nice more chopped version of the sampled part.
            This is where I get into my area of least expertise: lyrics. I usually have trouble picking out
            lyrics from songs with completely normal vocals. I just can't interpret on the fly. At best, the
            words go in one ear and out the other. One reason this review will take so long to right is A) I
            have a lot to say and B) I have to go look up the lyrics for each song to really understand them.
            From my reading on the genius annotations, Get Got seems to be about a car chase with the cops that
            Ride is in. He recklessly drives and seems to run a red light or pass a cop car and get in a crash.
            The second verse seems to talk more about just rap or making music in general, with Ride sort of
            bragging about his skill. Verse three gets more cryptic. There are pieces about duality like
            fire and water and references to the practice of trepanning I can pick out which seems to be about
            setting your thoughts free but this verse is quite tough to interpret. Anyway, overall, this is a
            great start to the album and even though I don't think it does a great job of representing the sounds
            on the rest of the album, It sounds good and is probably the only reason I kept listening. And then
            you get dropped into the thick of it (ksi referenece?) with <br></p>
            <h2>The Fever (Aye Aye).</h2> 
            <p>
                This is a much more traditional Death Grips song. It has some distorted main instrumental loop
                that sounds like it's partway between a saw and a vacuum cleaner. This song almost sounds like
                a factory or something with the sort of monotonous (not a bad thing) sounding drums. Mc Ride
                really starts to yell on this track and the energy goes crazy. Then the hook comes along with
                this nice funky melody that I just love. It sounds amazing. And that last chorus where all but
                the drums and Ride cut out is cool too. Overall this is just an excelently arranged track and
                if you are the type of person who enjoys the sound of Death Grips, it's quite catchy. Also by
                now I've decided that I'm dogshit at writing about lyrics especially cryptic ones like Death
                Grips so I won't even bother. I didn't start listening to them for the lyrics anyway.
            </p>
            <h2>Lost Boys</h2>
            <p>
                This song has the most robotic aesthetic production on the whole album. The immaculate
                intro where you can't really pick out what is going on and then the random noise coalesces
                into this amazing beat is heavenly. Then you get the text-to-speach sounding repetition
                of the word lost boy. This brings in even more of the robotic sounds. Ride has a quick verse
                and then the production sort of starts to break down. Half the the ticking sounds seem to
                drop off the face of the earth and overall this leads into a much more distorted sounding
                second verse. Ride has a longer verse now which sounds good. I don't really have much to say
                about the rapping on this song just the production. The third chorus of lost boys starts to
                distort the voice a bit more, though it comes back for the second half. I think the drumline
                loses another hit and this song seems to be going for the vibe of a rabbit hole. Ride's line
                "it's such a long way down" combined with the buildup of distortion contribute to this theme.
                Once again with my "overall", this track is a great addition to the album that I didn't
                really appreciate enough until writing this.
            </p>
            <h2>Blackjack</h2>
            <p>
                It's hard for me to put into words what I like about this track. The beat is kind of nice and 
                bouncy sounding and there is no real melody. The melody comes from the layered effects on Ride's 
                voice. Then we get a beat switch like 40 seconds into the song with much "crunchier" sounding
                drums and a droning note that creates a melody while sliding up and down. This was the easiest
                song to pick out lyrics to from reading them, with Blackjack seemingly being a metaphor for 
                something. Once again, if you came for lyrical discussion you came to the wrong place. Overall,
                the simple beat sounds great with the support from Ride's vocals.
            </p>
            <h2>Hustle Bones</h2>
            <p>
                Death Grips can really do a beat drop. This song starts with like a car or lawnmower sounding
                note that slides up until an extremely hard beat drop. I almost can't help but yell the
                succeeding lines "Give a fuck whatchya heard yeah, fuck whatchya heard." It just sounds good.
                Zach goes crazy on the drumline and Ride slows down the flow. Then the chorus comes in with
                this heavenly sounds that I can't decide if it is a synth preset or a chopped up sample of a
                girl singing. This repeats. I don't have much to say except this song goes hard. I come back to
                it pretty often if just for that beat drop. Ok it's 0:29 rn and I really want to write about
                I've Seen Footage because it's a banger but I'll do it tomorrow.
            </p>
            <h2>I've Seen Footage</h2>
            <p>
                Ok so that was not tomorrow. Anyway, I've Seen Footage is a banger. That instrument in the
                background at the start that I really need to learn the name of actually has an appealing sound.
                This is probably the second most accessible track on the album behind Get Got and also has listenable
                lyrics. From what I can glean, this song is about how in the insane mainstream where it's "beats
                swallowed by beats" almost in a sort of ouroboros, Death Grips stays niche. It's sort of funny
                how their song partly about overplaying of music and just mainstream music in general is one of their
                biggest. This song also seems to go into how you can see a lot of fucked up shit online like
                beheadings and how this keeps you paranoid or as the Grippers (kill me) say it, 'noided'. Ride describes
                the desensitization you feel after watching so much of this content. This flow and these lyrics
                over this beat come together for an amazing song, honestly probably the best intro to Death Grips.
                It's got a catchy beat that anyone can latch onto but the beat is still definitely them.
                MC Ride is still yelling but it's got flow to it. This song is almost like Death Grips lite,
                not in a bad way but just a tad less experimental and just is good.
            </p>
            <h2>Double Helix</h2>
            <p>
                This song used bells before yeat did. Bells at the start, beat comes in, kind of like Lost Boys
                but I kind of prefer how gradual that song did things. This is Ride's flex songs, where he raps
                about how cool and experimental he is. This song's Saharan Cellphone sample basically pops in
                every couple bars and is overall weird. If you zone out on this song and don't listed to what
                Ride is saying you'll end up like how I felt on first listen, where I thought this song
                dragged, but I was brought right back 2 minutes in when the music cuts with some ethereal sounds
                and then drops right in like nothing happens. Besides that, this song is just solid. Great drums
                on this song by the way.
            </p>
            <h2>System Blower</h2>
            <p>
                This is a song about sort of destroying the system. Death Grips harsh beats are coming in destroying
                the system of the mainstream while their insane bass on some of the other songs are "speaker ripping"
                As for this song, the beat is hard to describe. Just listen to the song, but the main part is
                chilled out so Ride can deliver another great performance. The drums go crazy when they cut
                this part during the chorus. Another good song. Look I'm not very good at this, I just thought
                it would be fun. Good song, tickle my ears. They sample subway train sounds at some point in this.
            </p>
            <h2>The Cage</h2>
            <p>
                The song is good. Ride isn't even really yelling on it. The main part sounds sort of like a
                distorted siren or something. Good shit.
            </p>
            <h2>Punk Weight</h2>
            <p>
                This is a strange song but also really fucking good. It's got this weird Saharan Cellphone
                sample looping for like 20 seconds and then the pitch drops a bit. Another 20 seconds and
                the drums are building. It sounds like this song is going somewhere... and then it completely
                fucking changes. This one noise repeating every bar, ear ripping bass as prescribed on System
                Blower. And it somehow gets boosted more during the chorus. I feel like I haven't been appreciating
                Ride enough. He is also really good on this song. This song simply could not work without his
                voice as could many other songs. Which is kind of weird, because I usually only say stuff Like
                that if the singer or rapper is providing like the melody for the song. But I don't really know
                how to explain it. Ride just yells his ass off and I eat that shit up.
            </p>
            <h2>Fuck That</h2>
            <p>
                Kinda mid. I forgot this song existed. I just want to get to hacker already
            </p>
            <h2>Bitch Please</h2>
            <p>
                Why so condescending? Geez Mr. Grips. The sample chop goes crazy. Industrial ass drums,
                main line going crazy. Mixing is not that great as I can barely hear Grips over the beat
                since he isn't yelling. The hook is just really good and the beat too.
            </p>
            <h2>Hacker</h2>
            <p>
                Damn that album was a fever dream, but we made it. Anthony fantano's song of the fucking decade. What more needs to be said. On the surface level, this track is an absolute goldmine of quotables and
                funny quips like "got the DNA of gothic lemons" "I got this pregnant snake" "shed my skin. Leave it for the homeless to sleep in." This is when the album reaches true peak insanity. Death grips is
                in your area, teaching bitches how to swim in the music industry they have been seemingly taking over this who album. Ride is past philosophy in this modern age, no more ins and outs. He will "grab
                your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane." This song sort of reminds me of the one scene in A Clockwork Orange. I'll add a gif for it at some point. But basically you are forced to sit
                and watch the maniacal verses about to unfold. Then quotables begin. Heavenly noises come on but they sort of sound twisted during the chorus, as Ride comes in and seemingly hacks you as the song
                title implies. He steals your shit. He knows where you live. As someone on Genius said, the line "I'm in your area" could be a reference to the porn site ads like "hot singles in your area" that I
                somehow get on youtube now, giving an attack vector. The second verse definitely snaps back to coherency a bit. Ride talking about how he's digitally murdering you with a jpeg to the head. Your the
                intern that's taking the blame when Wikileaks leaks your stuff. He is Jack the Ripper but a hacker. This verse drags us back to insanity with the aformentioned gothic lemon and homeless bars. Then
                we get another chorus, teaching bitches how to swim yada yada. The last quotable for me is "Soon your crew will be serving sandwiches named after me Vietnamese style, fool, please." Now we know what
                kinda food will be in the McRide happy meal. I feel like I haven't talked about the production enough. The chorus has insane production that just lets you feel the downward spiral and horror of Ride's
                mind and the horror of the hack. And as abruptly as a hack would start, the song ends with a second of glitched out and chopped up vocals and the album is over. God Hacker is a good song. I really only
                yapped about Get Got so much because I thought I had to because I didn't forsee the direction this review would go in but I just wrote about Hacker because I had so much to write. The off the wall
                lyrics really draw you in so you want to understand the meaning of the song. 10/10 masterpiece song. Only song of their's I've heard and would say is pretty close to this song's level is On GP (which
                I can play on my guitar btw.) Ok, even though I already missed a commit one day due to arriving home at 7pm on a school night, it is 11:55 and I do want to get a commit in today, so I'll end it here.
            </p>
            <h2>In conclusion</h2>
            <p>PLEASE listen to this album. I beg you. I can only do so much justice with my words with my limited knowledge on music reviewing. Good night.</p>
