    <h1>Privacy Policies</h1>
    <p>The things that exist for legal reasons that no one reads. My non-existant readers must be thinking "oh boy, another godamn cybersecurity nut article." Well this one is personal for me and this is actually quite important.<br>
    So recently my parents revealed that we are getting a ring video doorbell and I initially had some privacy concerns but I forgot about it for a while. Yesterday, my friends from supreme games and I were talking about and reading apple's privacy policy.<br>
    This morning, I woke up and checked discord as I always do and remembered about the ring and how we were talking privacy policies. So I pinged them and told them about how I'm getting a ring and want to know about the privacy policy. We spent some time reading and annotating the privacy policy for your leisure.<br>
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vZmyoeDYRk7E6Z-UCjHiqQH9PJ4vpu2JeHV01m8rumg/edit?usp=sharing">Please read this document and remember it or keep it open as I will refer back to it later. Thanks to Sam for helping annotate.</a><br>
    <strong>Pretty bad, huh?</strong> I believe the document stands on its own terms so I won't discuss the contents unless they pertain to the privacy section of ring's own site, their own pillars.</p>
    <h2>The site</h2>
    Now direct your focus to <a href="ring.com/privacy">ring.com/privacy</a>. I will be dissecting their pillars and some of the faq and most things on the site.</p>
    <h3>Pillar 1: Privacy and security built in</h3>
    <p>Please take a moment to read what it say underneath this pillar. Now ask yourself this: would a company focused on privacy be able to see everything my devices see. You could argue they should be able to see maybe a feed if there is suspicious movement but I don't really think that. But why would they need the temperature? The lighting?<br>
    Why would a privacy focused company take all of the information they can? This is not exactly evidence of a transgression but a thought process that is simple and reasonable. Don't sue me ring.</p>
    <h3>Pillar 2: Customers have control</h3>
    <p>Once again, read the below. Here I blatantly have evidence that this is a lie. Notice the area on the second page of the doc where it says how it basically ignores do not track settings. I thought this was against gdpr but I checked their EU privacy policy but this wasn't mentioned.<br>
    Wait a minute... ring lied in their privacy notice. "Our websites are not designed to respond" though they clearly are in the EU. Take that word though, 'designed'. Clearly their subdomain of say nl-nl.ring.com which I used to check this is included in "our websites", right? WRONG. (I always wanted to do that)<br>
    Actually it's "maybe, I need more information". It is very possible that Ring Europe is a separate company from the US one making this illegal. Being an Amazon subsidiary, I would sort of doubt this. If you have information please join my discord server and tell me. I have to know.</p>
    <h3>Pillar 3: Commitment to transparency</h3>
    <p>Read, you know the drill. One easy debunk of this is the difficulty of finding their privacy notice. It takes reading of small text and scrolling to see it. You have to start on the landing page, scroll to the bottom and click privacy, then scroll to the tiny text.<br>
    I don't know if there is on the app but this isn't good. This might not be enough evidence for you but you can decide this for yourself. In fact, I believe I have said a substantial amount for you to believe that ring is scummy. However that was not the point of this. </p>
    <h2>THE POINT</h2>
    <p>The point of this post/article is to show how the length and dullness of privacy policies hide a lot of shady behavior you do not want to share. If you are considering buying fucking cameras bro, either get cctv and livestream that shit to yourself or make a fuckin arduino or raspberry pi system. It's cheaper and safer (if you get encryption down).</p>
