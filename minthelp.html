	  <h1>I had to help install Linux Mint recently</h1>
	  <p>So my friend has been interested in linux for a while now. Most of my friend group has transitioned by now and I've been trying to convince him to switch for a while. He tried once before but the best linux for beginners, Mint, was having issues installing on his main pc. He wanted some help<br>
	  and remembering how hard installing it the first time was for me, obliged (even though my issues were mostly caused by not owning a usb drive). He had actually installed it earlier but something was wrong with his apt mirrors or something and after exhausting all other options, we decided to<br>
	  nuke it and reinstall. Once again, the install process went fine. My friend was a bit skittish this time because he was scared something would go wrong and insisted on asking me every step of the way and setting up timeshift for backups. I helped him install discord so we could screenshare<br>
	  instead of him filming with his phone. I helped him install steam, wine, lutris because he is a gamer. Oh yeah, and we spent about 15 minutes figuring out how to install librewolf. We ended up getting the appimage for it and integrating with appimage launcher because I couldn't figure out how<br>
	  to add custom launchers (I used Mint XFCE instead of Cinnammon). We eventually figured it out because he wanted desktop icons for everything. I tried to teach him some Vim and stressed that Vim is better than all of the pussy ass editors like nano or emacs but he didn't really care. I also taught<br>
	  him a bit about the filesystem and sudoers. He didn't understand why he needed sudo sometimes and I compared it to running as administrator. I'm not sure I have much more to say, I just wanted to take the some five hours we spent talking and shit when I could have caught up with these articles<br>
	  and use it as a topic. It is currently 11:47 and I'm trying to finish one more article by midnight which seems unlikely as I'll be talking about switching off of Mint and that is a longer story than this one. Thanks for reading!
