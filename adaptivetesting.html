      <h1>Adaptive Testing</h1>
      <p>I'm about to take an adaptive test which is part of Florida's new FAST test initiative which actually takes up another 6 hours every year. If you get a<br>
      question wrong, it will put you on a lower, easier track as an attempt to keep scores up. I believe that if you are dumb or don't know the concept, you should get a bad score.<br>
      However, higher scores mean higher budgets so we'll do this shit forever. Despite what our governor says, this is still standardized testing. I'll tell you more later but<br>
      they're just about to start reading the script.<p>
      <h2>I did the test</h2>
      <p>It was easy. The adaptive testing wasn't noticable. However, since the easier path is worth less points, it may cause problems with people's grades. Think of it like a rabbit hole<br>
      It starts off middle of the road. If you do bad, you get those worth more questions you get easy questions which are worth less. It makes it harder to save your grade.<br>
      I did notice that people got from 45-52 questions. I theorize that the lower the amount of questions, the better you did. I got 45.
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p><strong>FUUUUCK TESTING</strong><br>
      In all seriousness though, I hate how tests are dumbed down so even dumb people could do them.</p>
      <h2>Incentives</h2>
      <p>As a student, especially if you don't want to placed into a lower class (like aice down to normal). <br>
      under normal circumstances, it would be "if I wasn't shit my grade wouldn't be" - Pac. I guess this really shows how our school system is just a justification for where your tax dollars<br>
      are going to besides military and foreign intelligence instead of an actual attempt to teach kids. I think the government realized "wait, it's meaningless if our posterity is actually smart<br>
      we're just a fucking tiny speck of dust. We should all just kill ourselves." I've thought many such a thought. Is there a higher power? Why'd they make us like this? Why'd they even make us?<br>
      Why do I even exist? Now when Kirby's Epic Yarn is making you question your existence, you need to say "this is too easy" and go play Donkey Kong -The last two sentence have been brought to you by Video Game Dunkey.<p>
