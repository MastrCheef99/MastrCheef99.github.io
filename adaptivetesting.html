      <h1>Adaptive Testing</h1>
      <p>I'm about to take an adaptive test which is part of Florida's new FAST test initiative which actually takes up another 6 hours every year. If you get a<br>
      question wrong, it will put you on a lower, easier track as an attempt to keep scores up. I believe that if you are dumb or don't know the concept, you should get a bad score.<br>
      However, higher scores mean higher budgets so we'll do this shit forever. Despite what our governor says, this is still standardized testing. I'll tell you more later but<br>
      they're just about to start reading the script.<p>
