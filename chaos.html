    <h1>CHAOS</h1>
    <img src="img/D0045D9F-D0D2-4127-A153-8FA285078C45.gif">
    <p>So I've been reading some Bradbury, I finished Farenheit 451 and there's some thing I've noticed, particularly the brief spurts of chaos.<br>
    The first I noticed this was when Montag listens in on the McClellan's and is devolves in repetition of "One [name], two [name], three [name], etc." There are brief<br>
    moments of chaos like this throughout the first two parts, almost like Montag's inner self. He is starting to question his place in society. These continue with<br>
    things like Denham's Dentrifice. However, when the story gets really chaotic with Montag getting caught it is totally calm. This is probably due to Montag finally<br>
    really GETTING his place in the world. This is further exacerbated when he meets Granger and Crew and is given the task of recalling the Book of Ecclesiastes.<br></p>
    <h1>Farenheit 451 and Uglies</h1>
    <p>In my English class, my teacher is having us read <em>Uglies</em> by Scott Westerfield. Coincidentally, I picked up Farenheit 451 at the same time. They are extremely<br>
    similar in some aspects. Dr. Cabel is just another Captain Beatty, though Beatty is more compelling. The Smoke is like the railroad nomads as I call them. Even the rundowns<br>
    are similar. Something seemingly normal is slowly phased out of society and is eventually seen as evil. I knew Farenheit 451 was influential but I find it funny that I happened<br>
    right as I was reading it. I'm not very good at writing well formatted essays about books. Sorry about that mate.</p>
