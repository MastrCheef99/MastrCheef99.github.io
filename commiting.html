                <h1>Commiting to my New Years Resolutions</h1>
                <h2>Is not a good idea.</h2>

                <p>Boy what a week that was. My winter vacation ended and I realize that I can not keep up with my every-day-a-commit model. In this article, I will attempt to explain why (5 paragraph essay for english ahh sentence)<br><br></p>
                <h2>My git commits so far</h2>
                <ul>
                        <li>Day 1 - Created and worked on the tutorial socket.io app.</li>
                        <li>Day 2 - Made only 1 commit but it was completely revamping my spaced repetition app (see commits)</li>
                        <li>Day 3 - Installed and configured nix + hyprland all day (article coming soon) so I posted configs</li>
                        <li>Day 4 - Added a lot more configs to my nix configs repo, was still settng up all day</li>
                        <li>Day 5 - I needed a short project to work on because I was busy so I started up cs50x again, this project already got fucked up</li>
                        <li>Day 6 - Pivoted from rust to c++, A because I hate rust strings, B because C++ is my new friend</li>
                        <li>Day 7 - Not even sure if it is public but yesterday my friend invited me to his battlecode team so I worked on that</li>
                        
                </ul>
                <h2>These commits kinda SUCK</h2>
                <p>If you look at the commits, arguably 4 of them are barely anything. 2 are nixos configs that are kind of just frankenstein's monstered things from online and another 2 are cs50x. They are 3 problems in 2 different languages, one language a day. The 3 problems are:
                <ol>
                        <li>Hello World</li>
                        <li>Regurgitate user input</li>
                        <li>Use a basic for loop and take int input (which in the original cs50 is supposed to use a library anyway)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I don't really like to push out half baked commits but I also want to accomplish my dumb goal. If I actually sat down and worked, it would take me days to finish enough to be satisfied on something like my spaced repetition app so I can push. This doesn't work with my current model, so I have to push out either garbage code or barely any code. And let's not even talk about</p>
                <h2>Believe it or not, I have other goals outside of programming</h2>
                <p>I got homework to do. Clubs to attend. For god's sake I have to push out 1 of these a week and a youtube video once a month. This just isn't working out. Maybe I'm just too lazy. But thinking towards the future, what if I end up with another Donkey Kong December situation like 2024 where I need to play all day for the entire December part of winter break? I can't be writing code then. Therefore, we need</p>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>I will take about a week to deliberate a new "work-towards-commiting" model. The entire point of that goal was to get me on task and actually working on something programming. I have so much yet to learn after all. However, it has kept me working but not on the right things. I am proposing that each day I just have to work on some code that will eventually end up being commited. A reasonable amount of code, not just a comment here or there. This week should be pretty slam-dunk with battlecode so I'll see next week in an update if I switch to it. If you have any good solutions, reach out to me. Goodnight and goodbye.
