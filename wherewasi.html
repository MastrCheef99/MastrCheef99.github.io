            <h1>Where have I been for the past few months</h1>
            <p>...said no one ever.<br>
            no one reads this. Still, I would say that I've done or am planning to do some fun stuff so I though I would write some of it.</p>
            <h2>Game</h2>
            <p>I finally started work on my first game called "Mode". It was originally planned for the Bigmode game jam but I had never used godot and was busy with midterms<br>
            so I barely even started. I have a lot of stuff to do January so development has been put on a short hiatus but I have movement and some of my "modes" implemented.<br>
            I'll make a more detailed post about it when I'm ready but I can say now that I need to finish like 2 more "modes", add enemies and then I should be able to start<br>
            level design. I already have some ideas for some games I want to make afterwards but I won't jump there yet.</p>
            <h2>Melt</h2>
            <p>So my friend has been collecting aluminum cans and we are planting to melt them down into an ingot. Problem is, furnaces are expensive. We are planning a makeshift<br>
            furnace out of a steel pot, a blowtorch or charcoal, some plaster, and we need a crucible for the inside. Besides aluminum we are potentially looking to melt some other<br>
            metals for a rocket building project.</p>
            <h2>Robotics</h2>
            <p>I won't give enough information to doxx myself yet until something I do on GitHub might earn me a job or something so I'm just going to say this: my team is placed<br>
            extremely high in our region in the competition for a vex owned robot line. I have a competition coming up this weekend (not saying when that is) and I'm scared<br>
            about it but even if we do badly we might be able to make it to regionals.</p>
            <h2>Upcoming plans</h2>
            <p>I am planning to do a few things in the future that I will make posts about. For one, I'm planning to set up a home server on an old computer<br>
            I still need to get my parents' (parents's? both of my parent's?) approval since they might need either the disk reader or have data there that I can't delete.<br>
            On there I want to run a media server, backup to there, possibly a web server for this site (it would only be up from like 5-10 though since I don't pay for electricity,
            or internet) and a cloud password manager thing since I don't like leaving my information with apple.Hopefully I can use it to learn more about cybersecurity.<br>
            I am also planning to do some sort of bad apple video. My friend has been doing some videos <a>(https://www.youtube.com/@Blue-fd6ue</a>) and it seems pretty fun<br>
            so I wanna try my hand at it. Not sure what yet. Anyways, I'll probably run a public to do list or something instead of making</p>
