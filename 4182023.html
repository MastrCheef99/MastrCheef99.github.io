      <p>Today I want to introduce the blog and talk a bit about my self. If I had a bio for that info stealing bird app, it would contain "programmer" or "developer. <br>
      That looks pretentious and good right? Hello there, I go by the handle of MastrCheef99 and I program for a game site, my blog, and a couple games. <br> </p>
      <h2>Part 1 - Game site</h2>
      <p>I work on the game site supreme games, which I will not post the link to. I don't have a title, but I think "lead designer" would fit me best. I don't do much programming, <br>
        and I only add retro games using a site called emulatorjs which gives you an easy way to add retro games. In the future, I may post an example. However, to the lead designer, <br>
        I came up with many ideas for the sites ui, such as a homepage that uses analytics, our color scheme, a more user friendly proxy and I am in the proccess of changing all of our icons <br>
        to be more consistent. Next section <br></p>
      <h2> Part 2 - Blog </h2>
      <p> I just started this blog so I can talk about emulation, especially my settings and button mappings, and my developer competition. WARNING: THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY BLOG JUST EMULATION. I use an m1 mac so my options are limited, <br>
        though I plan to purchase a pc later this summer, probably in July. I emulate NES, SNES, and N64 begrudgingly through retroarch. I recently switched to open emu because, even if you change <br>
        the mapping on retroarch, IT DOESN'T FUCKING CHANGE. I noticed this during Super Mario World. I wanted to swap my Z and X key's functions but they wouldn't change. No N64 emulator actually <br>
        works on my mac besides through retroarch. I tried installing mupen 64 but it couldn't get graphics drivers or something so I have to use retroarch. I also use wii vc in dolphin <br>
        when I'm really fed up. Going down the generations, I believe the GB/GBC/GBA is next. For these, I use mGBA NOT under retroarch. I don't play gba games but I would like to play mother 3 soon. <br>
        Keeping on the handheld track, I use melon ds for ds games. I only have this for zelda as I originally wanted to play all the zelda game before TOTK but that never happened. <br>
        I obviously use dolphin, currently I'm playing RE4 and Jungle Beat, Wii version on both as it is easier to emulate. For Jungle Beat (I'll post the mappings later) I really tried to capture the hilarity of the original controls. <br>
        For ps1, I use Duckstation on its own. It's perfect for CTR, in which I'm addicted to time trials on crash cove, and MGS1, which I stream from time to time. <br>
        on the topic of Playstation, my computer can't get decent framerates on pcsx2 and my xbox controller doesn't work with rpcs3. <br>
        circling back to Nintendo Consoles I'd like to emulate, on my shitty 2020 macbook air, my CEMU immediately crashes whenever I try to play anything. Citra doesn't work on M1 and yuzu or ryujinx don't have mac. <br>
        I'm going on a long trip this summer so I won't be able to get a pc in time to play TOTK at better framerates and resolutions so I'll probably replay it when I get back. <br>
        On xbox emulation, I just use backwards compatibility with my series s and most xbox emulators don't work with mac. That's all on emulation so, next section.<br></p>
